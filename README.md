## Preliminary rules
1. Note that **independence and autonomy** in solving the project assignment is a matter of evaluation. **Please avoid to ask questions about implementation issues**. This kind of problems must be solved by yourselves, you can ask but such questions are kept into consideration for the final evaluation or even ignored.
2. **All the assignment are mandatory**, each variation or change must be previously discussed.
3. For the final debate you must provide: (following section for specifications)
  1. PDF report
  2. Set of slides used during discussion
  3. Code of the complete pipeline
4. During oral discussion **any kind of questions related to the course topics might be asked**.

## Required documentation
**Must be submitted 3 days before exam date**
* **_Report PDF_**: such document must be organized with the following format:
  1. Description of the assignment of the project and the focus of your work;
  2. Theory about CNNs focused on the application outline, providing references;
  3. Detailed description of the method you used (describe most salient aspects of your code too);
  4. Detailed description of the results (provide graphs, tables, etc.);
  5. Results discussion;
  6. Future development;
* **_Slide_**: must be used during oral discussion. Follow the structure of your report.
* **_Code_**: all the code you used must be provided. Carefully comment it and keep it well organized. Such criteria are matter of evaluation.

All the documentation will be available in the [documents](documents/) folder.

## Environment
Before launching the project is important to install the proper package (make use of [Virtual Environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)) by executing the command:
```

```
The folder with all the dataset must be named:
```
~/dataset
```
and must be created in the project root.
